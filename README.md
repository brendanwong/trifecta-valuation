# AMEX vs Chase Trifecta Valuation Calculator
A little side project I've been thinking about to combine my interest in churning and to practice front end dev and exploring new frameworks. The cards chosen were based off of benefit equivalence. Popular Chase trifecta combinations include the Ink Business Preferred but I chose the personal Freedom Unlimited to designate the lowest tier as a catch-all reward point generator for non-category spending over 1X back per dollar.


This is a calculator and visualization comparison of the Chase and American Express Trifectas which utilizes user spend input. If applicable, the annual fees for each card is applied after the first year of calculation. The personal Chase Freedom Unlimited card was chosen in place of the Ink Business Preferred, to compare to the American Express Blue Business Plus for a base level catch-all for non-category spend. With higher spend and/or redemption via transfer partners, it may seem that American Express will net you more return but factors such as benefits valuation/ease of credit use, current transfer partners for either bank, and other confounding variables such as American Express not being as widely accepted should be taken into account. 


TODO:
* remove summaries
* add sign up bonuses
  * maybe sliders for varying public offers like 50-100k for plat
  * 3x for first year with freedom unlimited
* add military waiver
* figure out how to decrease vertical size of inline input 
* turn third button into materialize modal with fixed footer
