# AMEX vs Chase Trifecta Valuation Calculator
A little side project I've been thinking about to combine my interest in churning and to practice front end dev and exploring new frameworks. The cards chosen were based off of benefit equivalence. Popular Chase trifecta combinations include the Ink Business Preferred but I chose the personal Freedom Unlimited to designate the lowest tier as a catch-all reward point generator for non-category spending over 1X back per dollar.


This is a calculator and visualization comparison of the Chase and American Express Trifectas which utilizes user spend input. If applicable, the annual fees for each card is applied after the first year of calculation.

The personal Chase Freedom Unlimited card was chosen in place of the Ink Business Preferred, to compare to the American Express Blue Business Plus for a base level catch-all for non-category spend. 

TODO:
* remove monthly summary
* add sign up bonuses
* add military waiver
* figure out how to decrease vertical size of inline input
