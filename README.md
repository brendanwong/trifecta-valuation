# AMEX vs Chase Trifecta Valuation Calculator
A little side project I've been thinking about to combine my interest in churning and to practice front end dev and exploring new frameworks. The cards chosen were based off of benefit equivalence. Popular Chase trifecta combinations include the Ink Business Preferred but I chose the personal Freedom Unlimited to designate the lowest tier as a catch-all reward point generator for non-category spending over 1X back per dollar.


TODO:
* add sign up bonuses
  * maybe sliders for varying public offers like 50-100k for plat
  * 3x for first year with freedom unlimited
* add military waiver
* figure out how to decrease vertical size of inline input
* ok apparently chase trifecta usually doesnt usually use csp i clearly use amex. change it to the chase freedom with 5% rotating sigh
